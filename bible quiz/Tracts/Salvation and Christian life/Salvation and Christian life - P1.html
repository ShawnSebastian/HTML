        <h3>Salvation and Christian life</h3>
      
       
      <P>
        Every human being desires salvation for their souls. But 
        how?. There arises a big question when we think about 
        attaining salvation or reaching heaven. From whence should 
        one be saved or delivered?. What is the element that forbids 
        him to accomplish this?. In the light of the teachings of all 
        religions as well as our own experience, it is the deliverance 
        from sin.
      </p>
  
      <P> Sin is the root cause for our lack of peace and contentment. 
      Jesus Christ is the only one who is revealed as the Savior of 
      sinners. He is called the Savior of the world because He saves 
      the sinners. Paul, the renowned disciple of Jesus Christ, says: 
      ‘Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners’ (1 Tim.1:15). 
      Therefore let us examine the salvation that Jesus Christ offers 
      and the rules for a fruitful Christian life. We use verses from 
      the Holy Bible as proof for this task. </p>

    <P> Man is a sinner; moreover he is a sinner right from his birth. 
     This is because of the sinful act of the first man, Adam. The 
     Bible says that ‘Sin came into the world through one man, and
     his sin brought death with it’ (Romans 5:12). All human beings are the 
     descendants of Adam; therefore all his children are born in his 
    (Adam’s) sinful nature. We are not sinners because of the sins 
    committed by us; we sin because we are born in that sinful 
    nature. Since we have the basic nature of sin within us, we 
    produce the fruits of sin.</p>

    <div class="panel-body"><B>What is sin?</B></div>

    <P> First of all we need to understand what sin is. Sin can be 
        explained as our disobedience and enmity towards God. It is 
        the breaking of God’s commandments and moving away from 
        God’s plan. The Bible says, ‘everyone has sinned and is far away 
        from God's saving presence.’ (Romans 3:23). Sin does not vary according to 
        one’s religion or tribe. Because of sin, we lost fellowship with 
        God. As we moved away from God’s presence, we all have 
        become sinners in His view. That doesn’t mean that we all 
        commit evil deeds, but we are possessed with a nature that can 
        commit any evil deed. It is Adam’s sin that dragged us in to 
        this situation.</P>

<P>The Bible says, ‘The wages of sin is death’ (Romans 6:23). We 
  have seen that it is not because of our deeds that we are born 
  as sinners, but Adam’s. Similarly, our own deeds cannot 
  deliver us from death, which is the punishment for sin. We 
  are guilty in God’s sight because of our sin; therefore we 
  deserve punishment. Our conscience always tells us this truth. 
  Fear of punishment robs us of peace of mind. The hatred, 
  enmity and violence we see in the world are results of sin. 
  There is no point in denying the fact of ‘sin’.</P> 
  
  <P>There are many kinds of sinners in this world; religious and 
  non-religious, God-fearing and atheists, wise and foolish, rich 
  and poor. But all are sinners before God.</P>
