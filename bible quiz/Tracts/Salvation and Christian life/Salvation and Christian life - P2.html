        <div class="panel-body"><B>What is the remedy for sin?</B></div>

        <p>Man has tried many ways to be rid of sin; even now he tries, 
           but in vain. Sin has intruded our thoughts, words and deeds. 
           Some take firm decisions not to sin anymore; but fail time and 
           again. Our good deeds cannot wash away the sins that have 
           already been committed.</p>

           <p> Is there a remedy provided by God for this big problem? 
            Yes, the solution is Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world. ‘But 
            now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been revealed. This 
            righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.’ 
            (Romans 3:21-22). The phrase ‘but now’ means, after Christ’s 
            death on the cross and his resurrection. Before that time God 
            gave men a chance to try for salvation through his own deeds. 
            But they couldn’t. God’s righteousness is the sum of His 
            attributes like power, holiness, etc. ‘God's anger is revealed from
            heaven against all the sin and evil of the people whose evil ways
            prevent the truth from being known.’ (Rom.1:18). The ‘wrath of 
            God’ is the attitude of God towards all that is against His 
            holiness.</p>
            
            <div class="panel-body"><B>Way of Salvation</B></div>

            <p>Jesus Christ came to this world to remove man’s sin justly 
              and thereby expressing God’s love and mercy towards him. It 
              was already mentioned that through the first man, Adam, sin 
              entered the world. Similarly through Jesus Christ, salvation is 
              also now attainable for the human beings. It was not by our 
              deeds that we became sinners; likewise it is not through our 
              deeds that God saves us. ‘all people were made sinners as the result
              of the disobedience of one man, in the same way they will all be put 
              right with God as the result of the obedience of the one man.’ (Romans 5:19).
              Though the disobedience of Adam made us sinners, the obedience of Christ now makes us 
              righteous. </p>
