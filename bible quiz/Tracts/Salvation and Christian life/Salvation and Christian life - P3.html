        <div class="panel-body"><B>How should one be saved?</B></div>

        <p>It is through faith that one must attain salvation. ‘Believe in 
        the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved’ (Acts 16:31). It is through 
        our belief in the Word of God that we realize that we are 
        sinners because of Adam’s sin. Similarly it is through the belief 
        in the Word of God that we understand the way of salvation. 
        God commands us to believe in Jesus Christ for our salvation. 
        1 John 3:23 says, ‘And this is his command: to believe in the name of
        his Son, Jesus Christ’. ‘All are justified freely by his grace through the 
        redemption that came by Christ Jesus. (Romans 3:23).</p>
        
         <div class="panel-body"><B>Salvation comes through our faith</B></div>
        
        <p>We cannot attain salvation by our deeds but through faith 
        alone. One must believe that Christ died for his sins and 
        because of Christ’s sacrificial death, the punishment for his 
        sin is removed. We may ask: Isn’t believing a deed as well? 
        Believing is like receiving with our hands a gift freely given by 
        someone. Salvation is the gift of God. We just need to accept 
        it with hands of faith. Faith does not generate salvation; it is 
        only a medium for receiving the salvation. ‘For it is by grace you 
        have been saved, through faith--and this is not from yourselves, it is the 
        gift of God- not by works, so that no one can boast’ (Eph.2:8-9).</p>

        <div class="panel-body"><B>Salvation is by God’s grace</B></div>

        <p>God saves us not because of our merits. In other words, we 
        do not deserve salvation. As sinners what we rightly deserve 
        is punishment. But God prepared a way for our salvation only 
        because of His grace. Grace is defined as ‘the undeserved 
        mercy’. ‘For the grace of God has been revealed, bringing salvation to 
        all people’ (Titus 2:11). ‘He saved us, not because of the righteous things 
        we had done, but because of his mercy’ (Titus 3:5).</p>
        
         <div class="panel-body"><B>Salvation is in Christ, in Christ alone </B></div>
        
        <p>There are many who ask: ‘Through which religion or church 
        can we attain salvation?’ Salvation is not in any religion; no 
        religion can save. But there is a man who can save; there is a 
        Savior. He is Christ Jesus. Salvation is in Christ - in Christ 
        alone. It is not in Christ and Christianity nor in Christ and 
        church, but only in Christ. ‘Salvation is found in no one else, for 
        there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must 
        be saved’ (Acts 4: 12). No rituals can save man from the 
        punishment for sin. Baptism or Holy Communion cannot 
        save man. Sacraments or charity cannot bring salvation. 
        Priests or angels cannot give salvation. Jesus Christ is the only 
        Savior; He is the only Savior of the world, no one else. ‘I am 
        the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father except 
        through me’ (John 14:6). </p>
