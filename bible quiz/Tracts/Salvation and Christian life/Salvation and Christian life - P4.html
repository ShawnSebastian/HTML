        <h3>Components of Salvation</h3>

        <div class="panel-body"><B>1. Repentance</B></div>

        <p>Repentance is not just regret; it is regret with a change of 
          mind. It is parting from sin and turning to God. A true 
          conversion of mind is what is required, not conversion of 
          religion or church. ‘In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but 
          now he commands all people everywhere to repent’ (Acts 17:30). 
          Repentance towards God and belief in Christ Jesus (Acts 
          20:21) is required for salvation. Confession of sin and hatred 
          for it is included in the repentance. Judas Iscariot confessed, 
          but did not repent. But Peter confessed and repented. When 
          a person is convinced of sin, repentance will happen. The 
          Jailor asked Paul: what shall I do to be saved? Paul’s reply was 
          to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ (Acts 16: 30, 31). Paul did 
          not mention anything about repentance to the Jailor because 
          his question was as a result of his repentance.</p>
          
          <div class="panel-body"><B>2. Freedom from sin </B></div>
          
          <p>The first thing that we feel when we are saved is the joy of 
          the freedom from our sins. The Holy Spirit convinces us that 
          as sinners we are destined for punishment. But the essence of 
          freedom from sin is that through our belief in Christ we are 
          excused from its punishment. In Luke 7:48 our Lord Jesus 
          said to the sinful woman, “Your sins are forgiven”. ‘In him we
          have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins’ (Eph.1:7). 
          When a sinner believes in Christ, he is granted forgiveness for 
          all his sins. ‘.. everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins 
          through his name’ (Acts 10:43).</p>
          
          <div class="panel-body"><B>3. Justification </B></div>
          
          <p>Justification does not make a person righteous; it is the 
          declaration that a person is blameless and without offence. It 
          is the settlement of a decree for punishment. ‘Who will bring 
          any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies’
          (Romans 8: 33). In short, justification is the cancellation of a 
          decree of punishment by a higher authority.</p>
          
          <p>Who is justified? Paul says, ‘the ungodly’, in the book of 
          Romans. ‘… the one who trusts God who justifies the ungodly, their 
          faith is credited as righteousness’ (Rom.4:5). The Lord illustrates 
          this through the parable of the Tax Collector and the Pharisee 
          in Luke 18: 10-14. The Pharisee tried to prove himself 
          righteous; while the Tax Collector, burdened with sin, beat his 
          breast and said, 'God, have mercy on me, a sinner’. The latter 
          went home justified before God. Justification is a step above 
          forgiveness. It is God’s act of accepting a sinner who believes 
          in Christ as a sinless person.</p>
