        <h3>Difference between Justification and Forgiveness of sin</h3>

        <p> Forgiveness of sin is the deliverance from the punishment 
            of sin. In other words, it is the cancellation of punishment for
            a committed sin. But justification is the declaration that the 
            above person is sinless or considered righteous. God has 
            provided not only forgiveness but justification also in Christ. 
            In the Old Testament in 1 Kings 8:32 we see Solomon’s 
            prayer. There he says, ‘The God who condemns the wicked 
            and justifies the righteous’. While in the New Testament, God 
            justifies the ungodly sinner.</p>
          
            <p>Justification is through Grace (Romans 3:24)</p>
            <p>Justification is through the Blood of Christ (Romans 5:9) and </p>
            <p>Justification is through Faith (Romans 3:28)</p>
             
            <p>The origin of justification is by God’s grace while 
            justification is made possible through the blood of Jesus 
            Christ. And we own the justification through our belief in 
            Christ.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><B>Assurance of Salvation </B></div>

<p>One must attain salvation during his life on earth. The Bible 
does not give even the slightest hint that salvation can be 
attained after death; all evidence says it is not possible. Nor 
does the Bible refer to anyone who was saved after death. Not 
only can one attain salvation in this life, he can also live in that 
confidence. This confidence is known as the ‘Assurance of 
Salvation’. Some doubt if anyone can confidently say that he 
is saved; others say it is boastful to say so.</p> 

<p>See what the Lord says: ‘I tell you the truth, those who listen to my 
message and believe in God who sent me have eternal life. They will never 
be condemned for their sins, but they have already passed from death into 
life’ (John 5: 24). ‘Passing from death into life’ is a clear and 
definite experience. This does not mean that one will pass to 
life after his death, but has already passed to life the moment 
he believed. It is a clear transition from the state of death to 
the state of life.</p> 

<p>Apostle Paul also says this in Ephesians 2:1. ‘And he has made 
you alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins’. Here salvation is 
compared to resurrection. If a dead person comes back to life, 
we can surely say that he is alive. Again in v.8 he says: ‘For it is 
by grace you have been saved’. Not that you will be saved or you 
may be saved – but ‘you have been saved’. It is a definite thing 
which has happened already. This proves that there is a state 
where we can confidently say that ‘we are saved’. ‘For you were 
once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord’ (Eph.5: 8). Paul also 
writes to the Corinthians, ‘And that is what some of you were. But 
you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of 
the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God’ (1 Cor. 6: 11). He 
talks about a past life, spent in misconduct, and a present life 
where deliverance was obtained from the past. Therefore 
salvation is a real experience.</p> 

<p>The gift of the Holy Spirit is given immediately with 
salvation. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of God is not 
a saved person. ‘In him you also, when you heard the word of truth,
the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the 
promised Holy Spirit’ (Eph.1: 13, 14). ‘And if anyone does not have 
the Spirit of Christ, they do not belong to Christ’ (Romans 8: 9). After 
attaining salvation, there is no need to wait or pray for the 
anointing of the Holy Spirit. But we need to be filled with the 
Holy Spirit (Eph. 5: 18). Those who are filled with the Holy 
Spirit will walk in step with the Spirit; they will produce the 
fruit of the Spirit (Gal.5:25). ‘But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, 
peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control’ (Gal.5:22, 23).
Ephesians 5:18-33 detail a believer’s duty after being filled with the Holy Spirit.</p>
