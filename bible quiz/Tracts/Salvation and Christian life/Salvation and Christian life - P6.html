        <h3>What must a believer do?</h3>
<div class="panel-body"><B>1. A saved person must obey the Lord in baptism</B></div>

<p> Baptism is an important commandment of the Lord Jesus 
Christ (Matthew 28:19-20). It should be in the name of the 
Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, i.e., in the name of the 
Triune God. When a person is baptized in the name of the 
Triune God, he is confessing not only the divinity of the 
Father, but the divinity of the Son and the personality and 
divinity of the Holy Spirit also. The Father, the Son and the 
Spirit are not three different persons, but three personalities 
of the one and only God. Baptism is a commandment of the 
Lord. On the day of the Pentecost, Apostle Peter asked the 
three thousand Jewish men who were saved to take baptism 
(Acts 2:38). Apostle Philp preached in Samaria and baptized 
those who believed (Acts 8:12). It is written that men and
women were baptized; there is no mention of children as the 
apostles baptized only those who believed. The eunuch was 
baptized after he believed (Acts 8:38). It is clear from the 
eunuch’s question, ‘What prevents me from being baptized?’ that 
Philip mentioned the need of baptism also along with the 
gospel. It is the Lord who commanded to baptize those who 
believe. We are obeying that commandment when we baptize 
people. Thus the baptist and the baptized both obey the 
Lord’s command.</p>
      
<p>Paul was baptized after his salvation (Acts 9:18); in 
Cornelius’ home, those who believed were baptized (Acts 10: 
47-48); Lydia and her family were baptized after they believed 
(Acts 16:15); the Jailor and his household were baptized after 
being saved (Acts 16:33). Here ‘family’ and ‘household’ stand 
for those members who believed. Phrases like ‘Spoke to everyone 
in that house’ and ‘his entire household rejoiced because they all believed 
in God’ (Acts 16: 32-34) affirm that those who were baptized 
were baptized upon their belief and were not children.</p>

<div class="panel-body"><B>The significance of Baptism</B></div>

<p> Baptism proclaims to the world that a person who believes 
in Christ has died, been buried and resurrected with Christ 
(Rom.6:3, 4; Col.2:12). Baptism is not a means for salvation, 
but a declaration of one’s salvation. The right method is the 
baptism of immersion; sprinkling of water is not baptism at 
all because it cannot portray the death, burial and resurrection 
of Christ. The order we see in the New Testament is to believe 
first and then take baptism. The New Testament teaches only 
about believers’ baptism, not adult baptism. A person’s belief, 
not age, is important to obey this command. Christ did not 
command his disciples to baptize children. There is not one 
evidence in the New Testament about a child being baptized. 
It talks about baptizing in the name of the Father, the Son and 
the Holy Spirit after one has believed. </p>
      
<div class="panel-body"><B>2. A saved person must separate himself from sin</B></div>

<p>The Church (Assembly) is a group of saved people. Before 
a person is saved, he would be of a particular religion or any 
church denomination; but when he is saved he becomes a 
child of God. It is essential for a child of God to dwell in 
fellowship with other children of God. Therefore a separation 
is required from their previous associates; a separation from 
unbelievers and traditional rituals. The Bible says, “Therefore, 
come out from among unbelievers, and separate yourselves from them, says 
the LORD. Don't touch their filthy things, and I will welcome you. And 
I will be your Father, and you will be my sons and daughters, says the 
LORD Almighty." (2 Cori.6:17, 18). They must separate 
themselves from wrong teachers and their teachings. Since the 
world holds enmity towards God, we must keep ourselves 
away from it (1 John. 2:15-17; John 15:18, 19; Rom. 12:1, 2).</p> 

<div class="panel-body"><B>3. A saved person must worship the Lord</B></div>

<p>It is the duty of a believer to worship his God. The basis of 
our worship is the redemption God has fulfilled for us
through Christ. In worship we do not ask from God, instead 
we offer him the sacrifices of praise and gratitude (Hebrews 
12:15). When we are saved, we not only become children of 
God but also a royal priesthood, worthy of worshiping in 
God’s presence (1 Peter 2:4, 5, 9). While talking to the 
Samaritan woman (John 4), the Lord says that worship must 
be in spirit and truth. ‘…the true worshipers will worship the Father 
in spirit and truth’ (John 4:23). It is the children of God who 
worship; and they worship the Father. Therefore, the unsaved 
have no right to worship God. No particular place or rituals 
are required for worshiping God. The New Testament does 
not give importance to the place of worship, but to the person 
being worshipped.</p> 

<p> In the New Testament worship, the Lord’s Supper is highly 
regarded. ‘They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to 
fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer’ (Acts 2:42). By 
observing the Lord’s Supper we remember the Lord and obey 
His commandment (Luke 22:19). The bread is to remember 
His body and the wine, His blood. The bread and the wine do 
not change its properties as the body and blood of Christ. 
What we eat is the bread and what we drink, the wine. The 
teaching about the Lord’s Supper is detailed in 1 Cor. 11. ‘For 
as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s 
death until he comes’ (v.26). Remission of sin does not happen 
by participating in the Lord’s Supper. Only people who are 
saved and whose sins are removed by believing in Christ 
should participate in this. The nominal churches (namesake 
churches) have turned the two ordinances given to the 
believers by the Lord, (baptism and the Lord’s Supper) as the 
way of salvation.</p>
