<h3>The Christian Life and Services</h3>

<p>Christ living in a Christian is the real Christian Life. ‘I have 
been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me’
(Gal. 2:20). Christ is the Vine and believers are its branches 
(John 15:5). Our relation to Christ is about life. The sap of 
Christ’s life is flowing to us thereby enabling us to do spiritual 
services and live a fruitful spiritual life. The vine produces fruit 
through the branches; similarly because of our union with 
Christ, we also yield the fruit of the Spirit (Gal. 5:22, 23). We 
become capable of doing good works instead of sinful deeds.</p>

<h3>Things to remember in Christian Life </h3>

<p><strong>Testimony :</strong> We must testify with our mouths to others that 
Christ Jesus is the Savior and Lord. Once, we did confess 
when we believed and were saved (Rom. 10:9); but the Lord 
commands us to testify before others even after that (Matt. 
10:32). This will help in leading them to Christ and to stand 
firm in our belief.</p>

<p><strong>Good Deeds :</strong> Our good works are not required for salvation; 
but we need it as proof of our salvation. ‘For we are God's 
handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared 
in advance for us to do’ (Eph. 2: 10). Other religions teach men 
to attain salvation through good deeds. But the New Testament demands that we be saved through belief and to then do good works. ‘….all who trust in God will devote themselves 
to doing good’ (Titus 3:8).</p>

<p><strong>Prayer :</strong> Prayer is the power station for one’s spiritual life. A 
Christian life without prayer will be full of failures. Prayer is 
essential in order to overcome the devil’s schemes. The Lord 
tells His disciples to pray so that they will not fall into 
temptation. It is through our prayers that we realize God’s 
will. Prayer is not just to tell something to God. It is a time to 
be with Him and strengthened. We have commandments like 
‘pray at all times’ and ‘pray without ceasing’ (Rom.12:13; Phil. 
4:6; 1 Thess.5:17).</p>

<p><strong>Reading and Meditating the Word of God :</strong> If prayer is the 
respiration of a spiritual child, God’s Word is its food. We 
must grow by consuming the Word of God, which is like pure 
milk (1 Pet. 2:1-2). The Word of God is not only food, but 
it is our light as well. ‘Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my 
path’ (Psalm 119:105). The Word of God also has the power 
to cleanse us. ‘You are already clean because of the word I have spoken 
to you’ (John 15:3). It is the sword of the spirit for us to fight 
against Satan (Eph.6:17). We understand God’s will through 
the written Word of God. The Doctrines and Ordinances of 
the Church are based on the written Word of God, not 
tradition or history. It is through the inspiration of the Holy 
Spirit that we comprehend Scriptural truths. ‘All Scripture is 
breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction,and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, 
equipped for every good work’ (2 Tim. 3: 16-17). Not only must we 
read the Scriptures, they must be meditated upon (Psalm 1:3). 
Meditation is like chewing the cud.</p>

<p><strong>Consecration :</strong> A believer must consecrate himself and 
whatever he owns for the glory of God (Rom.12:1). This 
includes spirit, body, wealth, time and all. Our body is the 
temple of God; therefore we must glorify God with our body. 
We are not the owners of anything we possess, but just 
stewards. We must spend our money for God’s work and for 
fulfilling the needs of God’s workers. It is our duty to practice 
hospitality also (Rom.12: 13; Heb.13: 1; Acts 16: 15). Our lives 
must be a model for others; otherwise no one will accept our 
words. We may become a hindrance for the spreading of the 
Gospel.</p>
