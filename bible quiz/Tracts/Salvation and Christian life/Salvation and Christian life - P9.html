        <h3>Hope concerning the future</h3>

        <p>A believer is a person with hope. Before salvation he had no 
        hope at all (Eph. 2:12). Hope is the anticipation of a better 
        tomorrow. Just as Christ is the center of our salvation and life, 
        He is the focal point of our hope also (1 Tim. 1:1). Since this 
        is the doorway to our future blessedness, it is called the 
        ‘Blessed Hope’ (Titus 2:12).</p>
        
        <p>The object of this hope is the second coming of our Lord 
        Jesus Christ (John 14:1-3). Christ’s promise is to keep His 
        people with Him where He is. Not only the believers who are 
        alive but those believers who are dead will also be part of this 
        (1 Thess.4:13-16). When Christ appears in the sky, the 
        trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and 
        the living will be transformed (1 Cor.15:52). This is when the 
        Rapture of the Church (the Church being taken into the skies) 
        occurs; i.e., we will be joined with Christ. Our bodies will be 
        transformed to be like the glorified body of Christ (Phi. 3:21). 
        This is the coming of the Lord that the Church awaits (Phi. 
        3:20, Col. 1:7). Then the Lord will give due rewards to the 
        believers according to the services that they did for Him. This 
        period is called the ‘day of the Lord’ (2 Tim. 4:7, 8; Phil. 2:16).</p>
        
        <p>After this, the Lord will come back to this earth along with 
        the Church to fulfil His promise to the people of Israel. This 
        is called the coming of the Son of Man (Matt. 24:30). During 
        this period the world will be governed by the antichrist and 
        will pass through ‘the Great Tribulation’. This instance is also 
        referred as ‘the glorious appearance of Christ’. As a result, 
        Christ will remove the antichrist from his rule and will bring 
        back all the Israelites to their nation and take over the 
        governance of this world. Christ will rule the world for a 
        thousand years, keeping Jerusalem as the world capital, as 
        stated by the Prophets. This is called the millennial reign of 
        Christ. After this period, the final judgement will take place. 
        All the dead will rise again; those who have not accepted 
        Christ as their Savior will be sentenced to eternal punishment.</p>
        
     <p>Dear friend, where will you spend your eternity? If you 
        accept Jesus Christ as your personal Savior to receive the 
        remission of your sins while living on earth, you can escape 
        from the dreadful punishment described above and live with 
        Christ forever. ‘Indeed, the right time is now. Today is the day 
        of salvation’ (2 Cor.6:2). ‘… people are destined to die once, and 
        after that to face judgment’ (Heb. 9:27). We urge you to own this 
        free salvation before the door of grace is closed.</p>
